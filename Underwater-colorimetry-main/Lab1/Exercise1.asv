% Those are Raw images, convert them in the same way as your own image.



%   Instructions:
%   Change all "yourpath..." to the appropriate path on your computer


dngPath = 'yourpath...\dng';  
tiffSavePath = 'yourpath...\tiff';
CompresedPngPath = 'yourpath...\Cpng';
stage = 4;

cd('yourpath...\Underwater-colorimetry-main\camera-pipeline-nonUI-master')
dng2tiff(dngPath, tiffSavePath, stage);
tiff2png(CompresedPngPath, tiffSavePath);







%% Part II: Show linear and non-linear image side by side


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% In this cell we show a linear and non-linear images side by side %

%                Include here ONLY GoPro image                     %

%       .jpg image as an example for a NOT linear image            %

%         .png image as an example for a linear image              %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%   Instructions:
%   Change non_linear_image.jpg to a .jpg image from your GoPro.
%   Change linear_image.png to a .png image from your GoPro.
%   Try few different B to see which one looks best.

I_linear = imread('non_linear_image.png');
I_Not_linear = imread('non_linear_image.jpg');

B = 2;

montage({B*I_Not_linear, B*I_linear})

% You should see your linear and not linear images side by side.
% You can change brightness by changing the scalar B
