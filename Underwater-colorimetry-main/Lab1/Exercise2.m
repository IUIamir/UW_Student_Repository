%% LOAD A LINEAR PNG IMAGE THAT HAS A CALIBRATION TARGET (Color Chart) IN THE SCENE
% 'NikonImage.png' is an example image, you can run the scrit to see what 
% is the expected outut. 
% 
% After you run the script with the 'NikonImage.png', change it to your 
% image from exercie 1!

I = im2double(imread('NikonImage.png'));

s = size(I);
figure;imshow(I*2)
title('Linear image','fontsize',20)



%% LOAD COLOR CHART DATA
% This example is given for a Macbeth ColorChecker.

load MacbethColorCheckerData.mat

% Location of grey patches in Macbeth ColorChecker.
neutralPatches = [4 1; 4 2; 4 3; 4 4; 4 5; 4 6]; 

% Y value of grey patches of a Macbeth ColorChecker.
neutralTarget = [89.57 57.76 35.15 19.44 9.08 3.43]./100; 

% Modify these to work for your color chart, if different than a Macbeth
% ColorChecker.


%% MAKE MASKS FOR THE PATCHES OF THE COLOR CHART
% It places the masks for each patch on the image, and waits for the user 
% to drag each mask over the correct patch.

% Once each mask is aligned its corresponding patch, the user should 
% double click the first patch in the chart that will accept the masks 
% for all patches.

% In a Macbeth ColorChecker, the first patch is the Dark Skin (top left).



% Generate masks using makeChartMask function
masks = makeChartMask(3*I,chart,colors,20);

% Define the save path, adjust the directory as needed.
savePath = 'Your_Path...'; 

% Create the folder if it doesn't exist
if ~isfolder(savePath)
    mkdir(savePath); 
end

% Saving masks struct as: masks_struct.mat
saveFile = fullfile(savePath, 'masks_struct.mat');

% Save the masks struct to a .mat file
save(saveFile, 'masks');

% Confirmation message
fprintf('Masks struct has been saved to %s\n', saveFile);



%% CHECK THE LINEARITY OF CAMERA RESPONSE  
% In this cell we will validate image linearity.


% RGB values extracted from patches 
% Dimensions 3 x size(neutralPatches,1)
neutralValues = getPatchValues(I,masks,neutralPatches,colors);


% Plotting Y values vs. RGB values
figure;
plot(neutralTarget, neutralValues(1,:), 'or', 'LineWidth', 2)
hold on;
plot(neutralTarget, neutralValues(2,:), 'og', 'LineWidth', 2)
plot(neutralTarget, neutralValues(3,:), 'ob', 'LineWidth', 2)
